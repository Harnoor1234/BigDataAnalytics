# Waste Management using Big Data

EECS6893 Big Data Analytics Project

Team Members: Hadeel Ahmad Albahar, Shreya Yathish Kumar, Harnoor Singh Powar 

Waste Management has always been a topic of discussion since the outburst of technology ensued by population rise and improper infrastructure. In this project, we are trying to advance New York City’s goals to reduce landfill waste by encouraging every New Yorker to audit their waste to green their homes and workplaces. 

This shall be achieved by the following:
 
• Providing heat maps to identify areas which are saturated with recycling bins and those which are underserved and could be improved 

• Analyze the density of recycling bins over the population in that area 

• Analyze the datasets over various parameters in any region of NYC to determine which areas are classically generating a lot of wastes and which areas recycle which kind of waste (paper, reuse, MGP) in a better manner 

• Visualize the results of clustering using choropleth heat maps embedded over Google maps 

• Suggest DSNY some interesting ways to achieve the goal of zero waste 


Dataset: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Public-Recycling-Bins/sxx4-xhzg) 

• DSNY's Refuse and Recycling Disposal Networks- For each Community District, the name and address of the location where Refuse, Paper, and Metal/Glass/Plastic collected in that district are disposed of under normal operating circumstances (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DSNY-s-Refuse-and-Recycling-Disposal-Networks/kzmz-ivhb) 

• Special Waste Drop-off Sites- Addresses and coordinates of each of 5 special waste drop-off sites where New York City residents can dispose of automotive batteries, motor oil, oil filters, passenger car tires, transmission fluids, fluorescent light bulbs, thermostats, household batteries, and latex paint (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Special-Waste-Drop-off-Sites/a34j-ihvy) 

• Recycling Diversion and Capture Rates-For each Community District, its Recycling Diversion rate (percentage of total municipal solid waste collected by the Department of Sanitation (DSNY that is disposed of by recycling) and Capture Rate (% of total Paper or Metal/Glass/Plastic in the waste stream that is disposed of by recycling)(https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/Recycling-Diversion-and-Capture-Rates/gaq9-z3hz) 

• popultion by community in NYC:https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/New-York-City-Population-By-Community-Districts/xi7c-iiu2 

• DSNY's record of mothly tonnage of wastes:https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DSNY-Monthly-Tonnage-Data/ebb7-mvp5
